Modified WaveNet Architecture for Supervised Learning Tasks

The goal of this project is to provide a model for speech classification and/or regression using WaveNet architecture which is originally designed as a generative model.
So, this project provides an API for various supervised learning tasks related to speechs.
Note that our implementation is based on keras2 on tensorflow background.
